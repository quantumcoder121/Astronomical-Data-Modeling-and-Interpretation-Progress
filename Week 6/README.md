# DTR
Decision Tree Regression is a common ML Algorithm to classify objects. Here, we have to first of all split the data into train and test sets. 
The train set is used to train the Algorithm and the test set is for validating it and checking its accuracy. 
We have used the scikitlearn module in Python for making and training the Decision Tree. 
Implementation available in dtc.py or dtc.ipynb.
# Random Forest
In Random Forest, we actually have multiple decision trees and each tree is trained using different subset of the data. This ultimately avoids overfitting the data. The final prediction is taken as the mean of each Tree in the Random Forest.
