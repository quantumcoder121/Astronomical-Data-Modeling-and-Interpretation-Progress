# Basic Joins
This is a folder that has sql files to implement a basic join command. Check the query.sql file. The init.sql file is for making the database.
# Join Keyword
This is a folder thst has query.sql for implementing the JOIN ... USING keyword.
# Outer Joins
I have implemented the LEFT OUTER JOIN command in query.sql. This is actually the least time consuming command and we can see that in the query.sql file in Subqueries folder.
# Subqueries
Subqueries are basically queries within queries (Like in brackets syntax-wise). These are implemented in Subqueries/query.sql. A comparison w.r.t. time has also been made between the Outer Joins and Subqueries method for joining tables in this file.
