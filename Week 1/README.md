The solution code for Q (i) of this Assignment is the Python script "Rolling_Dice.py". Please note that in order to run the script you need 4 Python modules - NumPy, MatPlotLib, Random and Math. Once you run the script, it will ask you enter the number of experiments to be performed. On entering that, it will display the histogram. We can note that for substantially large number of observations, the expected probability is obtained as can be seen in the histogram. Answer to Q(ii) of the assignment can be found in "Assignment Q3 Answer.pdf". For Q(iii), the solution is the Python script "String_Sort.py". Here, I have implemented the Merge Sort Algorithm which is quite fast. For running this script, first put "String_Sort.py" and your data file(preferably a .txt file) in a folder and run "String_Sort.py". It will ask you to enter the name of file which contains data (Strings on each line). After you enter the Strings will be displayed.
