# Introduction and Overview
This is the link for a quick review of my progress in the Project : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YRyl79p-NKa6zII8U-iWkacauMOlPMM8B_Ma-BKHupM/edit?usp=sharing where you can add comments to my progress. I have added both python scripts as well as Jupyter Notebooks so use whichever you want.
# Further Plans
Further, I am planning to build a Django App which will implement all the Python Scripts provided in this repository. This will help the Astronomy Community a lot I hope.
