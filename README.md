# Week 1 (Assignment)
The solution code for Q (i) of this Assignment is the Python script "Rolling_Dice.py". Please note that in order to run the script you need 4 Python modules - NumPy, MatPlotLib, Random and Math. Once you run the script, it will ask you enter the number of experiments to be performed. On entering that, it will display the histogram. We can note that for substantially large number of observations, the expected probability is obtained as can be seen in the histogram.
